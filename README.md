# Programming-L1

Mentorship Repository for Programming Type = Level 1
> [www.twoleaps.com](www.twoleaps.com)

## Repository Navigation Guide
* Mentee needs to fork this repository.
* Mentor needs to join as a contributor.

This template is designed to assist Twoleaps mentorship program. The template consists of two 
major sections: Goals and Progress tracker. Mentors and mentee should add goals prior to start of 
mentorship. Goals should be such that both party agree on. Progress tracker is to be updated on week
by week basis with new tasks to complete the defined goals. For each week, a folder in the repository
has to be maintained which captures the work done. It can be a small essay of things learned or written
code etc.

## Providing Feedback

Regular feedback is highly encouraged. Feedbacks should inspire improvement. Mentors should summarize week by week progress in form of feedback whenever possible and add it to the weekly work folder in form of *week1/feedback.md*

## Timeline

<Add mentorship timeline here in weeks. Example: 8 weeks starting 1st February>


## Goals
The objectives of the mentorship should be listed down here. They can be customized over time by the mentor
or the mentee's preferences.

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1
  - [x] Install linux on laptop
  - [x] Install C++ compiler on linux. ( if ubuntu use this [link](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-compile-and-run-c-cplusplus-code-in-linux/) )
  - [x] Learn git and github
    - [ ] Practice on [trygit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
  - [x] Write first [Hello world](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples/print-sentence) program in C++ and upload to Github.
  
### Week 2
  - [ ] Things to learn
    - [ ] Type of variables in C++.
    - [ ] Using 'for' loop.
    - [ ] Using 'if' statements.
  - [ ] Programs to write.
    - [ ] Write a program which takes two numbers from a user X and Y and prints sum, substraction, multiplication and division of those values.
    - [ ] Write a program which takes one number X from user and prints all numbers from 0 to X. Example X=5 then, output= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    - [ ] Write a program which takes one number X from user and print factorial of X. 
    - [ ] Write a program which takes one number X from user and print reverse of X. Example X = 21 then, output = 12.
    - [ ] Write a program which asks user to enter his name N and prints all the vowels in the name. Example N=aditya, output = a i a
    - [ ] Write a program which takes one number X from user and print "MAGIC" if the number is a multiple of 100. Means if i enter 100, 200, ... 100000 output should be "MAGIC".
